    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup khoya (mawa) or milk solids</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>A pinch of baking soda</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons milk (as needed to form a smooth dough)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for deep frying</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Prepare the Gulab Jamun Dough:

In a mixing bowl, crumble the khoya to remove any lumps.
Add all-purpose flour, ghee, and a pinch of baking soda. Mix well.
Gradually add milk and knead to form a smooth, soft dough. Be careful not to over-knead.</li>
        <li> Shape the Gulab Jamun Balls:

Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth balls, ensuring there are no cracks. Make sure the balls are uniform in size for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Fry the Gulab Jamun:

Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium heat.
Once the oil is hot, reduce the heat to low-medium.
Fry the Gulab Jamun balls until they are golden brown, turning them gently for even cooking.
Remove them from the oil and drain on a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Soak in Sugar Syrup:

While the Gulab Jamun balls are still warm, immerse them in the warm sugar syrup.
Allow them to soak for at least 1-2 hours so that they absorb the syrup and become soft and sweet.</li>
        <li>Serve:

Garnish with chopped nuts if desired.
Serve Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature.</li>
