    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup glutinous rice (also known as sweet rice or sticky rice)</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>1 ½ cups coconut milk
</li>
        <li>½ cup sugar
</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt
<li>2 ripe mangoes, peeled, pitted, and sliced </li>


       
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the Rice:

Rinse the glutinous rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
Soak the rice in water for at least 4 hours or overnight</li>
        <li>Steam the Rice:

Drain the soaked rice and place it in a steamer lined with cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel.
Steam the rice for about 25-30 minutes, or until it's tender and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Coconut Sauce:

In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, sugar, and salt.
Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves. Do not boil.</li>
        <li>Combine Rice and Coconut Sauce:

Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl.
Pour 1 cup of the coconut sauce over the rice and gently fold it in, allowing the rice to absorb the coconut mixture. Let it sit for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Dish:

Serve the sticky rice on a plate or in bowls.
Arrange sliced mangoes on the side or on top of the rice.</li>
<li>Garnish:

Drizzle additional coconut sauce over the top.
Optionally, sprinkle sesame seeds and garnish with mint leaves for a pop of color and extra flavor.</li>
<li>Serve:

Serve the Mango Sticky Rice warm or at room temperature.</li>
