    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Coffee Mixture:

Brew strong coffee and let it cool to room temperature.
Mix in the coffee liqueur and sugar, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the Mascarpone Filling:

In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
Add the softened mascarpone to the egg mixture and whisk until smooth.</li>
<li>Whip the Cream:

In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
 <li>Combine Mascarpone and Whipped Cream:

Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until well combined. Be careful not to deflate the whipped cream.</li>
 <li>Assemble the Tiramisu:

Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture and layer them in the bottom of a serving dish to create the first layer.
Spread half of the mascarpone filling over the ladyfingers.
Repeat the process for the second layer, ending with a layer of the mascarpone mixture on top.
</li>
<li>Chill:

Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate the Tiramisu for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
<li>Serve:

Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder and garnish with chocolate shavings if desired.</li>
